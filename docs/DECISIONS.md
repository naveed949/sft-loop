# Decisions

This log records project choices that later agents should not rediscover. Each entry states what we chose and why.

## Why the model map is in the repo (2026-10-20)

Cloud agents read Cursor rules from this repository. They do not read a developer's home directory. The per-role map therefore lives at `.cursor/rules/pstack-models.mdc`.

`# budget: medium (high)` means each role starts at high reasoning. That trades some reasoning depth for lower cost compared with the xhigh skill defaults named in poteto-mode.

Naveed picks the budget. Do not change the map or the budget unless Naveed asks.
